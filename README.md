# Geiger
Geiger Counter ESP32 WiFi
Geiger counter with ESP32 board and Wi-Fi connection with HTML web page. 
This is a demo version and shows the capabilities of the device. 
It was written on Arduino with the intention of sending coordinates to a server to be marked on a map with the reported data. 
The device works but not as originally intended. At the moment I don't have time for a realization that needs funds. 
If you are interested and donate, I can share the code and if you decide you can modify it according to your wish.
